Integration of New Descriptors for Improving Word Embeddings in Sentiment Analysis
This project focuses on integrating new descriptors to improve word embeddings for sentiment analysis on tweets using the Sentiment140 dataset. 
We apply text preprocessing, word embeddings (Gensim), Machine Learning algorithms, and Deep Learning models for sentiment classification.
